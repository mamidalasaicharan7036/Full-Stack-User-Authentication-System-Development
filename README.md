In this project, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive user authentication system 
comprising signup and login functionalities using HTML and CSS for the front end, coupled with 
Node.js to manage server-side operations. Leveraging MongoDB, I efficiently stored and 
managed user data, showcasing proficiency in full-stack development and database 
integration for dynamic web applications.
